Ember Questions
===============

1. Ember/Handlebars with i18n
2. Significance of underscore in template name
3. How does naming controllers and Routes magically connect them to resources
  * e.g. this.resource("posts").  If I name a controller App.PostRoute magically is connected to the correct route.  Not cool
4. Is this like Django notation for going through an object graph?
  * e.g. "post_id" is same as post.id
5. Is it possible to only have camelCase in ember
