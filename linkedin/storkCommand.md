Create Local Stork Command
===========================

To develop emails you need to use the stork admin tool.  The script for it is buried in the network emails folder.  To make it easier to access do this:

```bash
cd $LEOHOME/content/static/tl/emails
sudo cp dev_tools/stork-local-dev.sh /usr/local/bin/stork
```
