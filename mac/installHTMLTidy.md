Install HTML-Tidy 5
====================

I would recommend using HtmlHint instead of this
This is a useful tool for linting HTML.  There is a SublimeLinter plugin
https://github.com/htacg/tidy-html5

1. Use Homebrew to get it

  ```bash
  brew install tidy-html5
  ```

2. This will create a `tidy5` command

3. This will put Cellar/tidy-html5 into /usr/local and will symlink the tidy5 command into /usr/local/bin
