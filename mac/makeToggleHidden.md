Make Toggle Hidden
==================

Make it easier to see hidden files everywhere

1. Make a new script file

  ```bash
  touch /usr/local/bin/togglehidden
  ```

2. Copy https://github.com/brandyn1bennett/documentation/blob/master/bashScripts/toggleHidden into it

3. Make it executable
  
  ```bash
  chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/togglehidden
  ```

4. You may have to run it twice to make it work the first time
